                  <p class="whiteText">Hi! My name is Jason. I was born three days after 9/11. I am from San Francisco but grew up in China. Originally, I am from China. During my free time, I like to play badminton. In the future, I want to be product manager or software developer Since I was a little kid, I've loved eating sushi. 
                    My favorite hobby are playing badminton and watching films. I 3rd year student at UC San Diego major in computer engineering </p>
                  <p class="whiteText">My goal is to attend college to get a B.S. degree in computer science or engineering. I want to be a computer software and hardware engineer because I have
                     enjoyed math, physics, and computer science.  As a kid, I loved to play with lego.
                      When I was in elementary school, I disassembled broken electronics, such as a radio, cassette player, cell phone, and telephone, and reassembled them because I liked 
                      to study how the circuits were connected. I have not made any of these broken electronics work, but I always told myself that I have to fix at least one of these 
                      electronic devices when I grow up. During my two and a half years of computer science classes in high school,  I also enjoyed programming. </p>
                  <p class="whiteText">I am currently a student at ECE140a, where I learn technology skills in IoT (Internet of Things), coding in HTML/CSS and Javascript and Critical Career Skills.</p>
